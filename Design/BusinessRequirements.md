# Business Requirements

### BR1: We want a predictor to be able to create a prediction on an asset and for these predictions and their accuracy to be tracked over time.

- This business requirement describes the need for predictors to gain credibility and accountability so that regular users will follow their predictions. In turn, without this future software, predictors would have no way to gain such credibility. A business requirement is one that leads to the delivering of a solution. This requirement indicates a significant need for this software to be created.

### BR2: A regular user of the system should be able to read the predictions and make financial decisions based on the credibility of the predictor.

- This business requirement describes the need for users to be able to see the credibility of the predictors so that they know how likely their own financial decisions are to succeed. Without the credibility-building features of this software, regular users could blindly follow these predictions and possibly lead to financial distress.
