## Topics Discussed
Ryan Demo & API Security
- Erman asked whether the cloud server uses a public IP.
- He cautioned against public IPs, as they can expose the system to cyberattacks.
- Emphasized using strong passwords and proper security guidelines.
- He has seen real cases where public IPs became gateways for attacks.

User Authentication and API Input
- Users will need to provide a password, but this will be implemented in Iteration 2
- The API should **not accept** a created_at field from the client. This must be generated by the backend
- Any input from users could be malicious, so **strong validation** is important
  - For example, timestamps and IDs should be generated **only by the server**
  - The server should determine user identity through **token validation**, not user-provided IDs.
- Attackers could directly call the API (via curl) so endpoints **must minimize** accepted input

API Structure and Data Management
- Current API allows calling an ID and created_at timestamp using curl
- **Usernames should be unique**, but server-generated user IDs must remain consistent, even if the username changes
  - Current code may be assigning a default ID, which would need fixing
- Predictions API design example:
  - /predictions/{prediction_id} – for retrieving individual predictions.
  - /predictionsForUser/{user_id} – for all predictions by a specific user.
  - /predictionsForAsset/{asset_id} – for all predictions for a specific asset.
  - One postgres table can hold all predictions, with views used for filtering
- Erman will help find an alternative to yfinance

## Things Clarified
Iteration 2 Goals
- Further improve on the User class using notes from this meeting
- Implement authentication system
- Implement logic to resolve predictions with market outcomes
