## Topics Discussed
- Erman likes snow
- Erman is open to more feedback opportunities with him, and he expressed that it does not have to be the way it is now, with the once-an-iteration meetings.
- In the final product, listing all predictions in the database may not be necessary.

## Things Clarified
- We plan to dockerize the server so that it runs always, much like the database.
- Keeping up the trend from last iteration, Third iteration features 'sound good'!

## Client Feedback
- Input validation is critical.
- On the UI side, that is good. It should be done on the backend side.
- There are different ways to access the endpoints of our API, so it is best to add input validation to the backend.
- For financial asset input validation, the same API can be called to verify that the ticker is valid. That way, it is being done in the backend.
  - Return 404, etc. if it is invalid.
- There are ways to guarantee 100% prevention of sql injection.
- Security incidents occur around these instances
  - People open up their public IP instances, and their passwords are easy to guess.
  - Do not let that be the case here, do not let the database be easy to hijack
  - Erman is EXACTLY working on these things; AlloyDB.
