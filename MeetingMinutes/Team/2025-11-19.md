## Topics Discussed
- Backend file names are kind of terrible, 3 files named 'User', 3 named 'Prediction'.
- Cleaned up repository of branches that are not needed.
- Canvas assignment "Decouple your dependency" needs done!
- We have no idea what it means.
- It may be as simple as adding a connector file to the database folder that can be rewritten to work with other services like AWS.

## Things Clarified
- Clean code. Separate file names into their function. (e.g., user_routes, user_model, users (schema)).
- Activite Sh*t happens for decoupling assignment, we need to ask some specific questions tomorrow in class.
