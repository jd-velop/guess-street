## Topics Discussed
- Ryan is absent because of an essay he forgot about; understandable. Good luck!
- Gave Trello board some much needed love, including redistribution and creating a label system for priority among tasks
- Assigned a due date for each level of priority.
- The database needs to be running and easily accessible. We'll put Ryan on this, since he's the G.O.A.T.
- Authentication is the next step
- Credibility needs to be stored in the user class as an integer

## Things Clarified
  - URGENT: The database needs to be up and running and accessible at all times for development and testing
  - HIGH: Authentication (email verification) through JWT
  - HIGH: Finish User class and tests, including implementation of CREDIBILITY
  - MEDIUM: Resolve predictions with market outcomes
  - MEDIUM: Allow for account creation and logging in as a User
  - MEDIUM: Fully develop connection between Users and Predictions (tag predictions with corresponding userID, etc.)
  - LOW: Develop a Front End
  - BOTTOM: Update the Command Line UI to reflect new changes if Front End doesn't work out this iteration
