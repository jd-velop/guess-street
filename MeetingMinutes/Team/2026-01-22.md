## Topics Discussed 
- Elaine discussed interesting iterations on the lasagna structure.
- Email verification is going to require a URL sooner rather than later.
- We need to discuss with Erman how to do this.
- We also need to make an email address to send emails to users for verification, @gmail.com for now but custom domain names are simple to make with Google Workspace.
- We will need to dockerize the frontend and host it on google with a custom url.
- Removed clients/ repository from app/ folder.
- We plan to remove the database.py file as it is obsolete with our new modularity practices.
- Search functionality is needed, total frontend overhaul eventually
- Database needs cleared after input validation is addressed thoroughly

## Things Clarified
- We need to meet this weekend and have everything done by Sunday ideally.
- Meeting should be virtual

## Tasks Distributed
- Braxton will do input validation
- Ryan will do what he can (he's done everything asked of him already)
- Elaine is doing email verification (what she can without massive fundamental changes)
- JD will do what he can to polish the frontend
