## Topics Discussed
- What initially brought you to doing this sort of project?
  - Watching lots of YouTube videos about people making guesses about Bitcoin or Stocks or anything like that. The problem is that they can make guesses without anything coming from the result, so what’s to stop them from making these claims with no background evidence?
  - He wants to see how accurate a prediction was.
- What’s the capacity of use:
  - Two categories of users:
    - Predictors: those who want to make accurate predictions and get accredited based on how accurate they are.
    - End Users: people who watch the Youtube videos and read financial reports and what to know who to follow based on who makes the more accurate predictions.
      - 1,000 at most.
- Is this from the ground up? No.
- Are we scraping web content?
  - No, it’s just people who sign up for the application.
- What format are you wanting this in? Web-based or application-based?
  - Build the backend (Rest API) and small website that’s not necessarily published or anything.
- What is the primary goal of this project?
  - Question answers in the document.
  - For predictors: build credibility
  - For end users: be directed to the most creditable predictors for stocks, bitcoin, etc.
- For the actual predictors, what database 
  - Yahoo finance, but open to any other databases or APIs that we find.
- Are there any legal regulations we need to follow?
  - Probably not.
- His Background:
  - Undergrad in Turkey in 2004-8 in Computer Science
  - Masters in Turkey, Worked for a year and then came to the US in 2011
  - Came to the US and completed a PhD in Cloud Computing
  - Worked for LinkedIn
  - Working for Google → working on the security aspect of Google’s database aspect.
- Is your preferred way of contacting email? Yes. 
- What is the first thing you want to see in the first iteration?
  - This is exactly how they do it at Google: pitch idea, show progress, private preview, public preview, general admission
  - Making a prediction: maybe build it first in a virtual machine only accepting requests in the local network (private IP)
    - Stuff done primarily in the command line. 
  - Listing all predictions for a user
  - Don’t need to worry about authentication yet
  - Use this as an opportunity to learn how to build an application completely from scratch. 
- For authentication, in-house? Google?
  - Open to any authentication we find. 
  - Want a way to distinguish between a public user accessing the API versus someone from our team accessing the API.
  - Token? Tiered access?
    - There’s no difference from our perspective between an end user and a predictor. 
- Can anybody sign up as a predictor?
  - Yes, but that’s not going to mean that they will necessarily be credible.
- How many times a month would you like to meet with us?
  - Up to us → 30 minutes weekly, biweekly, or 1hr monthly. 
    - Tuesday and Thursdays are gym days
    - Fridays are for celebrating
    - Let’s stick with Mondays and Wednesdays. 
- What coding language to use:
  - Java is not a good language to build a back-end API
  - C/C++, function in/out has memory managed so well that you don’t have to clean up the memory usage afterwards.
  - Java/C# accumulate memory footprints over time and do not clean them out.
    - Comes to a point where they have to do a garbage collection, which stops all processing, cleans everything up, and then continues with requests.
  - Talked about Python and FastAPI → hasn’t heard of that 
- For any residual questions, send to gmail but continue to meet over personal email.


## Things Clarified
- The language used
- Where we're starting --> priorities
- His expectations
- Future meeting times of week

# Client Use of Software
Used to gain credibility in predictions of stocks/cryptocurrency and users able to follow predictions.
